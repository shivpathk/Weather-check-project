# Weather-check-project
It is a full stalk web project in which we can check weather of any cities in the world just by writing it's name 
I have created this site with the help of Thapa Technical Youtube Channel
In this project i have used Node.js, Express.js, HTML5 , Bootstrap 4 , and Browser JavaSript , and i have used API for JSON file of weather data from a free website

Thank you !!!!
